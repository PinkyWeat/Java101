# Java101

## Description

This repo is a first glance at Java and its syntax really.
I can already code on C language and currently am learning Python at Holberton. However, I'm going the extra mile in order to learn a quite used language by several enterprises of my interest.

This repo is build from the [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/universidad-java-especialista-en-java-desde-cero-a-master/) at Udemy

I am more into Artificial Intelligence and it is known to be coded with python, but I need the paycheck until then.
